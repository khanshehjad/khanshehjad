### Hey, I'm Shehjad! Nice to meet you 👋

🔭 I'm currently exploring new things and building generative adversarial networks at a startup.

🕰️ Before that, I interned as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs, KPMG Lighthouse & RBC Capital Markets.

🌱 In my spare time, I like to learn music production, read manga, travel, and play video games (especially open-world RPGs). I'm also interested in fashion, cooking, and working out but I suck :)
