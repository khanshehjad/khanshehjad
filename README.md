### Hey, I'm Shehjad! Nice to meet you 👋

🔭 I'm currently exploring new things and building generative adversarial networks to scale fine art production.

🕰️ Before that, I interned as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs, KPMG Lighthouse & RBC Capital Markets. I've also researched social media behavior and addressing loneliness for suicide prevention using deep learning at McGill.

🌱 In my spare time, I like to play guitar & produce music, read manga, travel, and play video games (especially open-world RPGs). I'm also interested in fashion, cooking, and working out :)
