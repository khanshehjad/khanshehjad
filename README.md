### Hey, I'm Shehjad! Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently exploring new things and helping build neural networks to scale fine art production. Before that, I interned at Goldman Sachs, KPMG Lighthouse & RBC Capital Markets. I've also researched social media behavioral insights and preventing suicide addressing loneliness using deep learning at McGill.

In my spare time, I like to play guitar & produce music, read manga, travel, and play video games. I'm also interested in fashion and working out :)
