### Hey, I'm Shehjad! Nice to meet you 👋

🔭 I'm currently exploring new things and building out trading strategies at an investment management firm.

🕰️ Before that, I interned as a software engineer at Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Mercari, ThinkData Works & KPMG Lighthouse.

🌱 In my spare time, I like to learn about music production, read manga, travel, and play open-world RPGs :)
